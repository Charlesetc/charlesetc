Hi! I’m Charles. I like tea, compilers, and have just begun looking into graphics programming.

I have been known to eat vast quantities of chocolate.

If you want to talk, my e-mail is “charlespipin” at the largest e-mail provider in history, or you can see my [twitter](https://twitter.com/charlesetc).
