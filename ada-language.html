<h1 class="title"><strong>Ada</strong>pting for safety</h1>
</div>
<p>There have been a lot of new compiled, strongly typed languages that have been popping up in recent years:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crystal (2014)</li>
<li>Swift (2014)</li>
<li>Hack (2014)</li>
<li>Kotlin (2011)</li>
<li>Typescript (2012)</li>
<li>Rust (2010)</li>
<li>Go (2009)</li>
<li>Idris (2009)</li>
<li>Julia (2012) ‚Äî <em>Julia has a type system, albeit not required, and is performance-driven.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>And even some older languages that have been having a surge in popularity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scala (2003)</li>
<li>D (2000)</li>
<li>OCaml (1996) ‚Äî <em>There have recently been two huge OCaml projects funded by Facebook and Bloomberg.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>At least from where I stand, there‚Äôs been a trend in recent years away from dynamic languages like Ruby and Python, and towards stricter type systems and better performance.</p>
<p>There has also been some research done into languages that don‚Äôt need garbage collection, namely Rust and D.</p>
<p>But I think there‚Äôs one language being left out.</p>
<h1 id="ada">Ada</h1>
<p>Ada is <strong>the original</strong> strongly-typed language. It was developed by the US Department of Defense in 1980 to be <strong>safe and fast</strong> enough for military, rocket, and space programming. The Boeing 777, for example, runs on 99.9% Ada.</p>
<p>Ada has <strong>optional garbage collection</strong>, and seems to support a wide range of programming styles, including OOP,contract-based programming, and java-like interfaces.</p>
<p>And guess what? It‚Äôs got first class support for <strong>immutability</strong>! From 1980! You can pass an object into a function with full assurance that it will not be mutated.</p>
<p>But you might say, <em>‚ÄúHold up just one second: Aren‚Äôt old languages usually super lacking in some departments? Like concurrency or parallelism or something?‚Äù</em></p>
<p>Well totally yeah! Excluding Erlang, all the old languages I‚Äôm familiar with (and some not-so-old languages) generally have a pretty tough time in this ol‚Äô mutliprocessor world of ours. C, C++, OCaml, Fortran, COBOL, Prolog, most scheme implementations, etc all have trouble with OS-independent parallelism. Not to mention Ruby, Python, and most scripting languages.</p>
<p>But wait! You guessed it! Ada has it‚Äôs own <strong>concurrency</strong> abstraction called <strong>Tasks</strong> that can be concurrently distributed over several threads. Think Go‚Äôs ‚Äúgoroutines‚Äù but, wait, designed in <strong>1980.</strong></p>
<p>There are a lot of other things that Ada seems to do right ‚Äî packages &amp; parallel compilation, (avoiding) pointers, generics / templates ‚Äî maybe I‚Äôll write about them another time. :)</p>
<h1 id="summing-up">Summing up</h1>
<p>I am hoping that learning Ada will teach me a lot about what a mature, strongly-typed language looks like.</p>
<p>It seems there was a collective decision to advance C instead of Ada. We spent 20 years working with more and more dynamic languages, and all of a sudden popular opinion is veering towards safe, compiled languages. Maybe Ada will fill this gap! üëª</p>
