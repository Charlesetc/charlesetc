    <p>I given both strongly typed languages and dynamically typed languages a fair play: I’ve had an on-and-off love affair with Haskell, and been forced to write large amounts of python to get paid.</p>

<p>Pretty much all of my coworkers would opt for a typed language as opposed to python given the choice. C++, Rust, Go, Java; I think we would all switch in a heartbeat.</p>

<p>The problem is, people code in dynamic languages for a reason. Here we go:</p>

<h1 id="speed">Speed</h1>

<p>Everyone talks about how much faster it is to code in a dynamic language. I think this is generally true, but this has nothing to do with compile-time checked types.</p>

<p>Anytime a fairly experienced developer writes a function, they know exactly what types they expect in that function! Maybe they’re thinking along the lines of an interface, but they still have an idea of the data that they are working on. It’s not like people are writing functions in python that are impossible to write in C or Go! I think the vast majority of the functions I write wouldn’t even need higher-kinded types like those seen in Haskell.</p>

<p>So can we agree that “thinking in types” is <em>not</em> what makes a typed language harder to write?</p>

<h1 id="type-annotations">Type annotations</h1>

<p>Strongly typed languages generally take longer to program in because of the process of physically typing the type annotations.</p>

<p>Every time you write a type in a function call you’re making an assertion: “This is an integer”. But if later, things change, and you find out you also want it to be able to take a float then you have to rewrite the type assertion that you’ve made to include this new case - maybe you say it’s a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Numeric</code> if we’re talking Haskell.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have to go through your program and rewrite every occurrence of what used to be an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Int</code> to now say <code class="highlighter-rouge">Numeric</code>. This is boring work that has to happen every time your program changes, and is completely unnecessary in a dynamic language.</p>

<h1 id="ok">OK…</h1>

<p>For the sake of argument, let’s say you agree with this statement: typed languages are slow because of the annotations. What’s the solution?</p>

<p>Full Program Type inference! (Never specify a type annotation again!)</p>

<p>This already exists in several languages: Haskell (and derivatives) and OCaml, to name my favorite. Haskell isn’t always able to type-infer everything about your program, but OCaml is! Why don’t people use it more often?</p>

<p>There are advantages to types beyond just simple safety guarantees - you get the nice inline documentation alongside code. So I’m not advocating for everyone to start using a type inferred language and leaving out all the types. Instead, the next time you start writing a 200 line python script to do something just-too-complicated-for-bash, why not give OCaml a try and save both keystrokes and your free time?</p>

<h1 id="ps">PS</h1>

<p>There’s a really cool <a href="http:/facebook.github.io/reason">new OCaml parser</a> developed by Facebook that makes the syntax a lot less foreign.</p>
