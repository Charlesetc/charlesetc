title:  "Stars take-off"
---

I'm working on a game `Stars` .
It's going to be a 3D game with cartoon-like graphics,
animated blob-like stars, and trippy shader-based skies.
But here's the thing, I don't know much about game development.

So I'm in New York, at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com),
to figure out how to build this game and game engine from the bottom up. It's built with custom OpenGL bindings using SDL for window management and user input. You can see the source code [here](https://gitlab.com/charlesetc/Stars). 

Oh, and `Stars` is built with the language [Pony](https://www.ponylang.org/discover/)!


So far ([commit ae8efe9](https://gitlab.com/charlesetc/Stars/tree/ae8efe9adf5c80e21d9dda710ffaad74d8e37247)), I have a beautiful rainbow triangle that I'm very proud of:
