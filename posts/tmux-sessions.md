[tmux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/tmux) is an awesome tool! I've used it literally constantly for about a year now.

And guess what! I didn't know about some very basic commands.

# List Sessions

Command:

```bash
<prefix>s
```

This shows you an interactive screen where you can which session you want to be in:

```bash
(0) + 0: 3 windows (attached)
(1) + 1: 1 windows
```

# Switch Session

Command:

```bash
<prefix>(
# or
<prefix>)
```

Move back and forth between sessions. Can you imagine!

# Main Development

I usually have a single session with several panes and windows. Now this can scale in a whole new dimension with more projects and ideas. Hurray!
