title:  "Stars Finale"

*I've been working with graphics on a project dubbed 'Stars'.
This is its last hurrah!*

Without further ado, here's a bourgeois pig:

<video width="600" height="504" autoplay loop> <source src="/videos/stars-11.ogv" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"'> </video>

(It's bourgeois because it's shiny and therefore expensive.)

So the lighting here comes in three parts. The first is what is called **diffuse** lighting.
It's the kind of light that bounces off a surface equally in every direction.

This is the bit of the fragment shader that renders diffuse light, i.e. the
code run for each pixel on the GPU:

```glsl
// pretend you are given these three vectors
vec3 position;
vec3 normal;
vec3 light_direction;

// calculate how light or dark this pixel should be
// by combining the normal and light direction
float brightness = dot(normal, light_direction);

// set the color between black and cyan
outColor = mix(vec3(0, 0, 0),
               vec3(0, 0.5, 0.5),
               brightness);

```

This does render a teapot! But it's a little
dark: the backside is completely black and it
looks kind of matt or chalky.

To make it look less chalky, we're going to add
a **specular component**. This is the kind of light
that reflects unevenly: instead of the diffuse light
that spreads out everywhere equally, the specular
light highlights spots where the light is shining
directly.

```glsl
// do some calculation to get the direction
// and intensity
vec3 camera_direction = normalize(-position);
vec3 half_direction = normalize(
    light_direction + camera_direction);
float specular = pow(
    dot(half_direction, normal)), 16.0);

// set the color to vary with specular
outColor = specular * vec3(0, 0.5, 0.5);
```

This gives us the shiny part of light!

Combining these two lighting methods, we get a fairly well-lit teapot:

But it's still strangely black in some places!
In reality, there is **ambient** light everywhere, bouncing off
of walls and floors.

Unfortunately, reflected light like that is really computationally
intensive to calculate, so there's a widespread hack to add ambient
lighting:

```glsl
outColor = vec3(0, 0.3, 0.3);
```

Yep, we just add a lighter color everywhere. And now we finally get a decently lighted teapot!

And that's all there is to basic shading! I also wanted to do some cel-shading â€” cartoon-like graphics. This turned out to be super easy, and took one line of code:

```glsl
brightness = max(ceil(brightness * 4), 0.0);
```

So here are two cel-shaded teapots! (Sorry I know they skip sometimes.)

<video width="600" height="504" autoplay loop> <source src="/videos/stars-13.ogv" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"'> </video>
<video width="600" height="504" autoplay loop> <source src="/videos/stars-12.ogv" type='video/ogg; codecs="theora, vorbis"'> </video>

I'm pretty happy with how this project has gone.
I've definitely learned a lot about graphics, and even
more about [Pony](http://www.ponylang.org/discover). (The
entire project is written in Pony.)
