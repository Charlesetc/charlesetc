On paper, [the Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com) is a fairy small YC company. 
Attendees come every 6 weeks, staying for 12, to work on their own tech-related projects.
At the end of a batch, the attendees have the option of going through the Recurse Center to
search for a job. In this sense, RC serves as a recruiting company. And that's pretty cool.

But that's not close to the best part.

Yes, working on your own projects solely for your own edification is a breath of fresh air. 

Yes, having a good shot at a job afterwords is sweet.

But ultimately, that's no different from sitting at home and programming for a couple months,
followed by a job hunt. Except, of course, that the environment they've made is so chalk full of inspiring 
people it's absolutely ridiculous.

# The Environment

Sitting across from you, there's an electrical engineer trying to go beyond single-threaded C.

On your right, the quirky guy who works at Facebook is on his fourth batch.

Behind you is a statistician who's here on a break from R. She's arguing passionately about the state of Julia with a math PHD candidate, who far prefers Haskell or Idris.

In the Library, there's another Haskeller mumbling about monadic transformers and purity whilst peacefully taking a nap on a beanbag.

In the quiet room, there's a guy who's just getting started programming. In the last 5 weeks he learned both React and Flask, and has since proceeded to make 4+ polished web apps that are already being used. 

You probably get the picture...

# The Environment

There's a girl who's stressed while working on a data science interview question, even though she's doing ten times more than she was asked to do and will surely ace the thing.

There's a hooded figure who thinks doing linear algebra in systems languages is fun.

There's a long-and-pointy bearded fellow who learns new languages by implementing complex distributed computing algorithms.

There's a university student who actually applied to YC during the batch. She's doing the whole "work for google and then start your own company" thing, while not being old enough to drink.

The takeaway -- Everyone is diverse and has diverse interests, and there is not a better environment to learn.

# Apply

Oh. You want to apply? [If you insist.](http://www.recurse.com)
