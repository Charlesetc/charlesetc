You have a large circle of friends. You all hang out together in large groups, engage in spontaneous outings, and overall have a blast. You play volleyball on the beach while intermittently sampling exotic chocolates. When Sunday morning rolls around, you pull up Atom and start hacking with Express and React. How else?</span></p>

<h1 id="python">Python</h1>

<p><img src="/images/python.png" alt="Python" />
<span>
You have 5 or so friends that you stick with. Sure, you might smile at passersby, but your friends are great! You don‚Äôt need any more. You have to admit, you and your friends are pretty similar. You all like black coffee and graphic (but not colorful) tees. When it comes to programming, Python is good. Python has what you need. You like Python. And Sublime. Definitely sublime.</span></p>

<h1 id="ruby">Ruby</h1>

<p><img src="/images/ruby.gif" alt="Ruby" />
<span>
You‚Äôre a social butterfly. You‚Äôll go to indie coffee shops with each of your friends and have fascinating conversations each time. You‚Äôve got lots of friends! Artists, bookworms, so long as they like Chai! Ooh yeah, when it comes to programming, you have fun! Whenever that pesky ‚Äúundefined method <code>parse</code> for nil:NilClass‚Äù comes up, you just define ‚Äòparse‚Äô on nil. Programming is easy;  this is how programming should be. You use vim - with LOTS of extensions. üòÅ</span></p>

<h1 id="perl">Perl</h1>

<p><img src="/images/perl.gif" alt="Perl" />
<span>
Your best friend and roommate is a C programmer named Brook. Brook is useful when your patience runs out, but other than that you tend to program alone. You two still play Nintendo 64, because have games really improved since then? Plus, you‚Äôve got a huge collection of games for Nintendo 64. You used to write bash but once you found PHP you were hooked. Honestly, how do people even make lists without that ‚Äò@‚Äô. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. You use nano.</span></p>

<h1 id="haskell">Haskell</h1>

<p><img src="/images/haskell.png" alt="Haskell" />
<span>
Aw yeah. You‚Äôre that one person in the math PHD seminar who still manages to have tons of friends. You don‚Äôt sleep very much; why sleep when you can transform monads? You maintain a couple open source parsing libraries and mostly hack on existing mercurial repositories that are accompanied by LaTeX papers. You use pen and paper. You tried vim once but it took too many keystrokes. You once tried to add a type system to your history paper.</span></p>

<h1 id="c">C</h1>

<p><img src="/images/c.png" alt="C" />
<span>
When you‚Äôre not mapping out dungeons to beguile your friends, or soldering your new mechanical keyboard, you‚Äôre programming C. You ssh into your raspberry pi and open up a clean install of vim. Why do people install plugins when there is so much functionality natively? You write C because it‚Äôs the most realistic. All other languages are just lying to you. Sometimes you write assembly, but only once you‚Äôve had a few beers. You see your friends once a month for the epic adventure. Other than that you‚Äôre room is nice and dark.</span></p>

<h1 id="rust">Rust</h1>

<p><img src="/images/rust.png" alt="Rust" />
<span>
Dude you like rust too? Have you seen the RFC about macros in type syn- ‚Ä¶you wrote a rust concurrency library? Okay - what are you doing tonight?</span></p>
